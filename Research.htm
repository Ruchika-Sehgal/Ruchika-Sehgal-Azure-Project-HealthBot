 <h2>CLINICAL RESEARCH</h2>
<p><br> As per the policies set by the Drug Authority of India, In accordance with our vision, having established a sound service delivery program conforming to the highest quality standards, we at ISIC are focusing our attention on education and research. To this end, our doctors and researchers have undertaken several clinical research projects. Our aim is to develop a facility which would provide a platform for basic researchers to interact closely with clinicians with a mission to provide cutting-edge solutions to existing therapeutic loopholes in medical science.<br> </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<p> <br>To achieve the aim of an integrated therapeutic and research facility is setting up a Basic Research facility as well as an Animal House at G groups for the Development of Cell-Based Therapies for Spinal Cord Injury Repair.<br>This research facility will include a Mammalian Cell Culture Room, Molecular Biology Lab and will be supported by a well established Animal House.<br>The role of the Basic Research Facility is to promote and facilitate the use of cell culture as a research tool and provide support to clinicians to study disease progression as well as effect of treatment at the molecular level. This facility will include a cell culture room comprising of state-of-art equipment required for establishment and maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells cell lines as well as primary mammalian cell cultures such as laminar flow hood, CO2 incubators, light phase dissecting microscope, a routine phase contrast microscope, etc. <br>In addition to this, a separate imaging area consisting of a fluorescence microscope with imaging facility will also be provided for immuno-fluorescence studies on cultured cells. Proper areas will be developed in the facility to facilitate culture media preparation, testing and screening, culturing of primary cells and established cell lines as well as their long-term preservation. Infrastructure to undertake advanced molecular and immunological analyses will also be developed.
